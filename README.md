# Rohit Jacob Mathew - @rohitjmathew

Hi üëãüèΩ, I'm Rohit Jacob Mathew, a Software Engineer from India working on building SecOps products at [Trellix](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/index.html). I am also an [Auth0 Ambassador](https://auth0.com/ambassador-program), a former Senior Software Engineer at [Turtlemint](https://www.turtlemint.com/) and a former SDE Intern at [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). While my interests currently lie in the development of scalable solutions, DevOps, Developer Relations/Dev Evangelism as well as smart AI based system, I'm excited by almost anything in tech.

## If I'm not coding, I am generally

- Staying up to date with the latest technological developments
- Binging Spotify playlists to find new unheard of artists
- Going for Gigs and Music Festivals
- Playing/Watching Football
- Attempting to not be an out of practice musician
