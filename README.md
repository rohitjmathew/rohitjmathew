# Rohit Jacob Mathew - @rohitjmathew

Hi üëãüèΩ, I'm Rohit Jacob Mathew, a Senior Software Engineer from India. I am currently working on scaling and building a reliable product for agents to sell insurance at [@turtlemint](https://github.com/turtlemint). I am also an [@Auth0](https://github.com/auth0) Ambassador and a former SDE Intern [@HackerRank](https://github.com/interviewstreet). While my interests currently lie in the development of scalable solutions, DevOps, Developer Relations/Dev Evangelism as well as smart AI based system, I'm excited by almost anything in tech.

## If I'm not coding, I am generally

- Staying up to date with the latest technological developments
- Binging Spotify playlists to find new unheard of artists
- Going for Gigs and Music Festivals
- Playing/Watching Football
- Trying new craft beers
- Attempting to not be an out of practice musician
